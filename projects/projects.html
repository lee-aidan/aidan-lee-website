              <p class="project-desc">
                For my master’s capstone, I’m analyzing large-scale electronic health record (EHR) data to characterize how disease severity
                manifests in the rare fungal infections histoplasmosis and blastomycosis. I’m using EHR-derived clinical indicators—including diagnoses,
                care setting utilization, comorbidity burden, and antifungal treatment patterns—to model patient trajectories across acute, post-acute,
                and longer-term phases of illness. By applying unsupervised statistical methods to these multidimensional indicators, I aim to identify
                data-driven severity phenotypes that are clinically interpretable and reflect real-world disease complexity, particularly in contexts where
                prospective cohort studies are infeasible due to disease rarity.

                In collaboration with PhD candidate Simon Camponuri, I’m developing a user-facing web platform for an automated coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever)
                forecasting model in California. My work focuses on building the data infrastructure and automation pipeline that ingests historical and ongoing
                environmental data alongside coccidioidomycosis case data, and integrates these inputs with an established environmental forecasting model described
                <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(22)00202-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
                The goal is to support scalable, reproducible cocci risk forecasting by streamlining data updates and model execution within an accessible web-based UI.

              <p class="project-desc">
                Using large-scale electronic health records and U.S. Census data, I estimate the prevalence of multiple invasive fungal diseases at national and state levels,
                including in states where these infections are not reportable. I model demographic, geographic, and climate-associated risk factors to identify patterns in
                individual- and population-level disease risk. This work addresses major gaps in fungal disease surveillance and contributes to national estimates of fungal burden.

              <p class="project-desc">
                To evaluate the reliability of electronic health record data for fungal disease surveillance, I benchmarked EHR-derived estimates of histoplasmosis and blastomycosis
                against the HCUP National Inpatient Sample. This project assesses how well real-world clinical data capture national patterns of disease and informs best practices for
                using EHRs in epidemiologic research on underreported infections.

                I developed a web-scraping–based informatics pipeline to harmonize clinical diagnostic codes across ICD-9, SNOMED CT, and ICD-10 for large-scale fungal disease surveillance.
                Given an ICD-9 or SNOMED CT input code, the system programmatically queries authoritative online resources, extracts hierarchical and relational mappings, and applies rule-based
                validation to generate standardized ICD-10 equivalents. This tool supports reproducible epidemiologic analyses by enabling consistent case identification across heterogeneous
                clinical datasets and legacy health record systems.

                For Marin County Health and Human Services, I developed an automated OCR-based pipeline to process Poison Control and Coroner’s Office reports ingested as PDFs. Using robust

                epidemiologic analyses on these data to support internal dashboards, surveillance, and public health reporting.

                age and how my decisions can meaningfully shape how information is accessed and understood.
